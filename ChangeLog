Sat Nov  5 15:57:59 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Version 0.5.

	* wdiff.c (putc_for_tputs): Compile only if HAVE_TPUTS.
	(initialize_strings): Declare locals only when HAVE_TPUTS.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco.

	* Makefile.in (realclean): Also remove stamp-vti.

	* Makefile.in: Force readpipe.c and writepipe.c through ansi2knr
	for non-ANSI compilers.
	readpipe.c, writepipe.c: Use <stdarg.h> when ANSI, instead of only
	<varargs.h>.  This ANSIfies those modules.

Wed Nov  2 00:51:02 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* wdiff.c: Have --ignore-case correspond to -i instead of -c.
	Reported by Roland McGrath.

	* configure.in: Check for const only after having found possible
	ANSIfying compiler flags, this is of no use to check it before.

Tue Nov  1 11:25:26 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Makefile.in: Clean up, following the one in GNU sharutils.  I
	will not detail all the changes here.
	* configure.in: Likewise.
	* wdiff.c: Use PRODUCT and VERSION instead of version.
	* acconfig.h: New file.

Tue Mar 22 08:39:29 1994  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* configure.in: Use AC_PROGRAMS_PATH instead of AC_PROGRAMS_CHECK,
	while defining DIFF and PAGER.  Add diff to the programs tested,
	so its full path is saved.  Avoiding SGI gdiff, define DIFF to
	non-pathed diff, instead of empty.

Sun Dec 26 16:38:50 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* wdiff.c (usage): Renamed from usage_and_exit.  Accept the exist
	status as parameter.  If error, only suggest --help on stderr.  If
	no error, provide full help on stdout rather than on stderr.
	Adjust callers.

	(main): Rename -V back into -v.
	For -v, write version on stdout rather than on stderr.
	For -C and -v, exit with status 0 instead of 2.

	explicit code.

Sat Feb  6 15:01:03 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* Makefile.in: In dist goal, ensure 777 mode for directories, so
	older tar's will restore file modes properly.

Sun Jan 31 17:14:46 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard@icule)

	* wdiff.c (usage_and_exit, main): Rename -v into -V.

	can override automatically configured choices.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

Thu Jan  7 20:06:23 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Makefile.in: Replace -DHAVE_CONFIG_H back to $(DEFS), since
	Autoconf now handles this appropriately.

Tue Jan  5 20:58:04 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* wdiff.c: Make almost all functions `static'.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

Fri Jan  1 14:51:11 1993  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Makefile.in: Reinstate $(CPPFLAGS), use it.  Richard wants it
	there.

	* Makefile.in: Using autoheader, derive config.h.in from
	configure.in.  Distribute config.h.in.
	Use config.status for reconstructing config.h from config.h.in.
	Have all $(OBJECTS) depend upon config.h.
	Replace $(DEFS) by -DHAVE_CONFIG_H everywhere.
	Always use -I. calling the C compiler, for config.h to be found.
	Remove config.h in distclean.
	* configure.in: Create config.h from config.h.in.
	* ansi2knr.c, error.c, readpipe.c, wdiff.c, writepipe.c,

	* wdiff.c (main): Always refuse -t if not HAVE_TPUTS.

	* wdiff.c (split_file_into_words): Interpret "-" as meaning
	standard input, for any or both input files.  Take a temporary

	(reformat_diff_output): Instead of opening files, rewind them.
	Reported by Ze'ev "Steed" Shtadler (Israel).

	*wdiff.c (main): Allow "" and "-" for representing standard input,
	but consistently store NULL as file name in these cases.  Disallow
	having standard input twice.

	* wdiff.c: Use error() instead of perror(), everywhere.  Include
	<errno.h> and declare errno if not defined.
	* configure.in: Use AC_VPRINTF, check for strerror().

	* wdiff.c: Implement -c for ignore_case.  I should have delayed
	this until the integration of wdiff into diff, but I personnaly
	needed it right now! :-)

	* wdiff.c (launch_output_program): Restrict the search for "less"
	to the basename of the program.
	Define strrchr to rindex when including <strings.h>.

	(main): Allocate temp_name statically, and initialize it to "".
	On certain systems, tmpnam(NULL) causes a segmentation violation.
	Length will be L_tmpman or else, PATH_MAX from pathmax.h.  Check
	temp_name before unlinking, in case of an intervening signal.
	* pathmax.h: New, from elsewhere.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute pathmax.h, adjust dependencies.

Mon Nov 23 08:48:41 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Makefile.in (dist): Get .fname from the current directory name,
	instead of from version.c.  I need updating many files manually,
	when the version changes, version.c is just one of them.

	* cbars.sh: New.  By default, cbars is not part of PROGS.
	* Makefile.in: Prepare, install, and distribute it.

Sun Nov 22 08:54:43 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* wdiff.c: Remove `const' to `char *strstr();' declaration.
	Reported by Roland McGrath.

Wed Nov 18 09:28:12 1992  Jim Meyering  (meyering@idefix.comco.com)

	* Makefile.in: Add another layer of double quotes so PAGER
	and DIFF may contain spaces.  Before, with PAGER='less -i'
	compilation failed with unterminated string.

Tue Nov 17 18:47:23 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* wdiff.c: Do not declare tgetstr without HAVE_TPUTS.

Tue Aug 18 03:57:06 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Version 0.03 to alt.sources and ftp.uu.net:/tmp.

Mon Aug 17 14:00:03 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* configure.in: Check for improper `const' support.

	* wdiff.c: Insure exit code values: 0 if no differences found, 1
	if any difference found, 2 for other reasons or errors.  Execute
	`diff' even in the case absolutely no output will result.

	* wdiff.c: Removed spurious comma after last enum item.

	* alloca.c: New, from other GNU sources.
	* configure.in: Check for alloca.

Sat Aug 15 09:27:31 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Version 0.02 to alt.sources and ftp.uu.net:/tmp.

	* wdiff.c: Added -s option to produce statistics at end of output.

	* wdiff.c: Copy common code from the left side instead of the
	right side if only the common code and deleted words are wanted;
	this makes the output spacing nicer.  Also, correct a bug by which
	added words were shown as common code for this option set.

	* wdiff.c: PAGER_PROGRAM was previously defaulted to "more", it is
	now left undefined.  As currently set, the auto-configurator will
	pick one, however, and force it into the program.

	* wdiff.c: Avoid all emphasis if all of the output would be
	emphasized the same way.

	* wdiff.c: Avoid overstriking whitespace unless the pager is less.

	* wdiff.c: Do termcap initialization and completion strings.  If a
	pager is used, insure they are sent to stdout, never to the pager.

	using any pager, instead of using a default PAGER.

Fri Aug 14 19:22:30 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* wdiff.c: Remove the `signal (SIGCLD, SIG_IGN);' which is a

	* Version 0.01 to alt.sources and ftp.uu.net:/tmp.

	* wdiff.c(setup_signals): Do not intercept SIGQUIT.

	* wdiff.c: Automatically pipe through `more' or `less' if writing
	to terminal, using environment variable $PAGER to override PAGER
	definition.  Force terminal mode, but if the pager is `less', use
	printer mode.  Modify copy_whitespace for overstriking whitespace
	with itself in printer mode: `less' understands this.
	* strstr.c: Borrowed somewhere from GNU.
	* writepipe.c: New, provided by David MacKenzie.
	* configure.in: Try defining PAGER to less or more.  Also use our
	strstr if necessary.
	* Makefile.in: Transmit PAGER to program.  Also handle strstr.c.

	* configure.in: Try defining DIFF to gdiff or diff.
	* Makefile.in: Transmit DIFF to wdiff.c, which handles it already.

	* wdiff.c: Options -wxyz renamed from old -1234.  New options -123
	acting a little like in GNU comm utility, old -d option deleted.

	* wdiff.c: Check for HAVE_TPUTS instead of HAVE_TERMCAP_H in many
	places.
	* configure.in: Use -ltermlib on LIBS for Xenix, -ltermcap
	otherwise; once this done, test for `tputs' availability.

	* COPYING.LIB: New.
	* Makefile.in: Distributing COPYING.LIB.

Tue Aug 11 15:10:37 1992  Francois Pinard  (pinard at icule)

	* Version 0.0 to alt.sources.
