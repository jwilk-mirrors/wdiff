GNU `wdiff'
***********

   `wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to
create the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with
terminals and pagers (notably with `less').  `wdiff' is particularily
useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have
been refilled.

   This is release 0.5.1.

Overview
********

   The program `wdiff' is a front end to `diff' for comparing files on
a word per word basis.  A word is anything between whitespace.  This is
useful for comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed
and for which paragraphs have been refilled.  It works by creating two
temporary files, one word per line, and then executes `diff' on these
files.  It collects the `diff' output and uses it to produce a nicer
display of word differences between the original files.

   Ideally, `wdiff' should avoid calling `diff' and do all the work
internally, allowing it to be faster and more polished.  However, I
loathe replicating the `diff' algorithm and development effort, instead
of improving `diff' itself.  It would be more sensible to integrate
`wdiff' into `diff' than the other way around.  I did it this way only
because I had a sudden and urgent need for it, and it would have taken
too much time to integrate it correctly into GNU `diff'.  Your advice
or opinions about this are welcome.

   `wdiff' was written by Franc,ois Pinard.  Please report bugs to
`bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  Include the version number, which you
can find by running `wdiff --version'.  Include in your message
sufficient input to reproduce the problem and also, the output you
expected.

Invoking `wdiff'
****************

   The format for running the `wdiff' program is:

     wdiff OPTION ... OLD_FILE NEW_FILE

   `wdiff' compares files OLD_FILE and NEW_FILE and produces an
annotated copy of NEW_FILE on standard output.  The empty string or the
string `-' denotes standard input, but standard input cannot be used
twice in the same invocation.  The complete path of a file should be
given, a directory name is not accepted.  `wdiff' will exit with a
status of 0 if no differences were found, a status of 1 if any
differences were found, or a status of 2 for any error.

   In this documentation, "deleted text" refers to text in OLD_FILE
which is not in NEW_FILE, while "inserted text" refers to text on
NEW_FILE which is not in OLD_FILE.

   `wdiff' supports the following command line options:

`--help'
`-h'
     Print an informative help message describing the options.

`--version'
`-v'
     Print the version number of `wdiff' on the standard error output.

`--no-deleted'
`-1'
     Avoid producing deleted words on the output.  If neither `-1' or
     `-2' is selected, the original right margin may be exceeded for
     some lines.

`--no-inserted'
`-2'
     Avoid producing inserted words on the output.  When this flag is
     given, the whitespace in the output is taken from OLD_FILE instead
     of NEW_FILE.  If neither `-1' or `-2' is selected, the original
     right margin may be exceeded for some lines.

`--no-common'
`-3'
     Avoid producing common words on the output.  When this option is
     not selected, common words and whitespace are taken from NEW_FILE,
     unless option `-2' is given, in which case common words and
     whitespace are rather taken from OLD_FILE.  When selected,
     differences are separated from one another by lines of dashes.
     Moreover, if this option is selected at the same time as `-1' or
     `-2', then none of the output will have any emphasis, i.e. no bold
     or underlining.  Finally, if this option is not selected, but both
     `-1' and `-2' are, then sections of common words between
     differences are segregated by lines of dashes.

`--ignore-case'
`-c'
     Do not consider case difference while comparing words.  Each lower
     case letter is seen as identical to its upper case equivalent for
     the purpose of deciding if two words are the same.

`--statistics'
`-s'
     On completion, for each file, the total number of words, the
     number of common words between the files, the number of words
     deleted or inserted and the number of words that have changed is
     output.  (A changed word is one that has been replaced or is part
     of a replacement.)  Except for the total number of words, all of
     the numbers are followed by a percentage relative to the total
     number of words in the file.

`--auto-pager'
`-a'
     Some initiatives which were previously automatically taken in
     previous versions of `wdiff' are now put under the control of this
     option.  By using it, a pager is interposed whenever the `wdiff'
     output is directed to the user's terminal.  Without this option,
     no pager will be called, the user is then responsible for
     explicitly piping `wdiff' output into a pager, if required.

     The pager is selected by the value of the `PAGER' environment
     variable when `wdiff' is run.  If `PAGER' is not defined at run
     time, then a default pager, selected at installation time, will be
     used instead.  A defined but empty value of `PAGER' means no pager
     at all.

     When a pager is interposed through the use of this option, one of
     the options `-l' or `-t' is also selected, depending on whether
     the string `less' appears in the pager's name or not.

     It is often useful to define `wdiff' as an alias for `wdiff -a'.
     However, this *hides* the normal `wdiff' behaviour.  The default
     behaviour may be restored simply by piping the output from `wdiff'
     through `cat'.  This dissociates the output from the user's
     terminal.

`--printer'
`-p'
     Use over-striking to emphasize parts of the output.  Each
     character of the deleted text is underlined by writing an
     underscore `_' first, then a backspace and then the letter to be
     underlined.  Each character of the inserted text is emboldened by
     writing it twice, with a backspace in between.  This option is not
     selected by default.

`--less-mode'
`-l'
     Use over-striking to emphasize parts of output.  This option works
     as option `-p', but also over-strikes whitespace associated with
     inserted text.  `less' shows such whitespace using reverse video.
     This option is not selected by default.  However, it is
     automatically turned on whenever `wdiff' launches the pager
     `less'.  See option `-a'.

     This option is commonly used in conjunction with `less':

          wdiff -l OLD_FILE NEW_FILE | less

`--terminal'
`-t'
     Force the production of `termcap' strings for emphasising parts of
     output, even if the standard output is not associated with a
     terminal.  The `TERM' environment variable must contain the name
     of a valid `termcap' entry.  If the terminal description permits,
     underlining is used for marking deleted text, while bold or
     reverse video is used for marking inserted text.  This option is
     not selected by default.  However, it is automatically turned on
     whenever `wdiff' launches a pager, and it is known that the pager
     is *not* `less'.  See option `-a'.

     This option is commonly used when `wdiff' output is not redirected,
     but sent directly to the user terminal, as in:

          wdiff -t OLD_FILE NEW_FILE

     A common kludge uses `wdiff' together with the pager `more', as in:

          wdiff -t OLD_FILE NEW_FILE | more

     However, some versions of `more' use `termcap' emphasis for their
     own purposes, so strange interactions are possible.

`--start-delete ARGUMENT'
`-w ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "start delete" string.  This string will be
     output prior to any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it
     starts.  By default, no start delete string is used unless there
     is no other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in
     this case the default start delete string is `[-'.

`--end-delete ARGUMENT'
`-x ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "end delete" string.  This string will be
     output after any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it ends.
     By default, no end delete string is used unless there is no other
     means of distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the
     default end delete string is `-]'.

`--start-insert ARGUMENT'
`-y ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "start insert" string.  This string will be
     output prior to any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it
     starts.  By default, no start insert string is used unless there
     is no other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in
     this case the default start insert string is `{+'.

`--end-insert ARGUMENT'
`-z ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "end insert" string.  This string will be
     output after any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it ends.
     By default, no end insert string is used unless there is no other
     means of distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the
     default end insert string is `+}'.

`--avoid-wraps'
`-n'
     Avoid spanning the end of line while showing deleted or inserted
     text.  Any single fragment of deleted or inserted text spanning
     many lines will be considered as being made up of many smaller
     fragments not containing a newline.  So deleted text, for example,
     will have an end delete string at the end of each line, just
     before the new line, and a start delete string at the beginning of
     the next line.  A long paragraph of inserted text will have each
     line bracketed between start insert and end insert strings.  This
     behaviour is not selected by default.

   Note that options `-p', `-t', and `-[wxyz]' are not mutually
exclusive.  If you use a combination of them, you will merely
accumulate the effect of each.  Option `-l' is a variant of option `-p'.

Actual examples of `wdiff' usage
********************************

   This section presents a few examples of usage, most of them have been
contributed by `wdiff' users.

   * Change bars example.

     This example comes from a discussion with Joe Wells,
     `jbw@cs.bu.edu'.

     The following command produces a copy of NEW_FILE, shifted right
     one space to accommodate change bars since the last revision,
     ignoring those changes coming only from paragraph refilling.  Any
     line with new or changed text will get a `|' in column 1.
     However, deleted text is not shown nor marked.

          wdiff -1n OLD_FILE NEW_FILE |
            sed -e 's/^/  /;/{+/s/^ /|/;s/{+//g;s/+}//g'

     Here is how it works.  Word differences are found, paying
     attention only to additions, as requested by option `-1'.  For
     bigger changes which span line boundaries, the insert bracket
     strings are repeated on each output line, as requested by option
     `-n'.  This output is then reformatted with a `sed' script which
     shifts the text right two columns, turns the initial space into a
     bar only if there is some new text on that line, then removes all
     insert bracket strings.

   * `LaTeX' example.

     This example has been provided by Steve Fisk,
     `fisk@polar.bowdoin.edu'.

     The following uses LaTeX to put deleted text in boxes, and new text
     in double boxes:

          wdiff -w "\fbox{" -x "}" -y "\fbox{\fbox{" -z "}}" ...

     works nicely.

   * `troff' example.

     This example comes from Paul Fox, `pgf@cayman.com'.

     Using `wdiff', with some `troff'-specific delimiters gives *much*
     better output.  The delimiters I used:

          wdiff -w'\s-5' -x'\s0' -y'\fB' -z'\fP' ...

     This makes the pointsize of deletions 5 points smaller than
     normal, and emboldens insertions.  Fantastic!

     I experimented with:

          wdiff -w'\fI' -x'\fP' -y'\fB' -z'\fP'

     since that's more like the defaults you use for
     terminals/printers, but since I actually use italics for emphasis
     in my documents, I thought the point size thing was clearer.

     I tried it on code, and it works surprisingly well there, too...

     Marty Leisner `leisner@eso.mc.xerox.com' says:

     In the previous example, you had smaller text being taken out and
     bold face inserted.  I had smaller text being taken out and larger
     text being inserted, I'm using bold face for other things, so this
     is more clear.

          wdiff -w '\s-3' -x'\s0' -y'\s+3' -z'\s0'
