1 Overview
**********

`mdiff' studies one or more input files altogether, and discovers
blocks of items which repeat at more than one place.  Items may be
lines, words, or units defined by user.  When in word mode, `mdiff'
compares two files, finding which words have been deleted or added to
the first in order to create the second, which is useful when two texts
differ only by a few words and paragraphs have been refilled.  The
program has many output formats and interacts well with terminals and
pagers (notably with `less').

   `unify' is able to convert context diffs to unidiff format, or the
other way around.  Some people just prefer one format and despise the
other, it is a religious issue.  This program brings peace back to
Earth.

   `wdiff', which originally gave the name to the package, is now
obsolete, and exists merely a front-end to GNU `mdiff'.

   `wdiff' and `mdiff' were written by Franc,ois Pinard, while `unify'
has been contributed by Wayne Davison.  Please report bugs to
`wdiff-bugs@gnu.org'.  Include the version number, which you can find
by running the program with `--version'.  Please include in your
message sufficient input to reproduce what you got, the output you
indeed expected, and careful explanations about the nature of the
problem.

2 The multi-difference finder
*****************************

The name `mdiff' stands for _multi-_`diff', and has the purpose of
encompassing the functionnality of a few other `diff'-type programs.
The prefix _multi-_ also stands for the fact the program is often able
to study more than two input files at once.

   The theory of operation is simple.  The program splits all input
files into a sequence of items, which may be lines or words.  `mdiff' is
then said to operate either in "line mode" or in "word mode".  It then
tries to find sequences of items which are repeated in the input files.
Such common sequences are called "clusters" of items, and each
occurrence of a repetition is called a cluster "member".  What remains,
once all cluster members are conceptually removed from all input files,
is a set of "differences".  The role of `mdiff' is to conveniently list
either cluster members and differences.

   When input files are very similar, it is likely that clusters will
encompass many items (lines or words) and differences will be small.
So, most listing options inhibit the printing of cluster members.
However, one may ask for the few beginning or ending items of cluster
members to be printed nevertheless, as a way to provide a kind of
feedback or "context" of the difference, those context items are
sometimes said to be at the "horizon" of the difference.  In merged
listings, cluster members may just not be printed, except maybe for a
few context items at the beginning of the member (just after a
difference), and a few context items at the end of the member (just
before a difference).

   When cluster members are short, or if you prefer, when the
differences are not far away from each other, it is quite possible that
the required context items often cover the full extent of the cluster
members, which then are not inhibited anymore when this happens.  A run
of differences intermixed with such non-suppressed members is called a
"hunk".  Some reports produced by `mdiff' are showned as a list of
hunks, and it is to be understood that common items are elided between
hunks.  However, each hunk in itself has no item missing, and each item
of the hunk is analysed as pertaining either to only one of the input
file or to many of them.  Each hunk is preceded by a header, which
explains the line position of all input files prior to the hunk itself.
By comparing a hunk header with the previous hunk header, the user can
have a hint about how much printing was spared.

   When two input files are quite similar, clusters are usually
presented in the same order in all files.  If a cluster member A in the
first file corresponds to a cluster member A in the second file, it is
likely that another cluster member B which appears _after_ A in the
first file will correspond to a cluster member B in the second file
which appears _after_ A as well.  So, in many cases, while producing
merged listing of files, cluster members may be made to naturally
correspond to one another.  However, this is not always true, in
particular when the second file has been produced from the first by
moving a big chunk of code away from its original position.  In such
cases, we say that members have "crossed".  When members are crossed
and `mdiff' has to make a merged listing, it selects one cluster member
as being _naturally_ associated with its correspondant (either the pair
of A's or the pair of B's) and then consider the other cluster as being
part of a difference.  The crossed nature of the member may still be
analysed and reported, or it may be ignored.

   The standard `diff' program is meant for when there are exactly two
input files, for which crossed members should be ignored.  `mdiff'
output format has been designed in such a way that it should resemble
`diff' output for this precise case.  However, `diff' formats are not
sufficient for representing all cases which `mdiff' may address, and
this is not mature yet.  That is why `mdiff', in its current state,
still experiments with output formats, which are subject to change.

   When the input files are not very similar, or rather different,
merged listings are not very significant nor useful, and may even be
rather confusing.  The best to do in such cases is using `mdiff' for
making an annotated relisting of all input files, in which cluster
members are properly identified and referred to one another.

   Statistics.

     Read summary: 137 files, 41975 lines
     Work summary: 439 clusters, 1608 members, 8837 duplicate lines

The summary lines, triggered by the `-s' option, say that about 8837
non-ignorable lines could be removed over the 41975 which has been read,
by using functions, `#include', `#define', or similar devices.

   If one manages to execute `mdiff' within GNU Emacs so the output
described above is collected into the `*compilation*' buffer, the
command `C-`' (`M-x next-error') will proceed to the next cluster
member in the other window, and similarily for other compilation mode
commands.  This is a useful way for handling `mdiff' output.

   Each line in the hunk, after the header, comes from the compared
files, but is shifted right so the first column (or the first few
columns) of each line gives information about where the line is coming
from.  A space indicates a line which is common to all files.  In case
there are only two input files, a minus sign indicates a line from the
first file and a plus sign a line from the second file.  Else, a letter
from `a' to `z', or more than one letter if there are more than 26
files, indicates to which file the line pertains.  If a line or a block
of line pertains to many files but not to all of them, the first column
holds a vertical bar, and the line or block of lines is bracketed
between `@/' and `@\' lines, which are kind of comments within the
hunk.  The initial bracket lists all file letters that are related to
the incoming line.

   I initially wrote `mdiff' specifically to help cleaning a C++
project which was a bit large, and in which many big monolithic classes
were derived from each other most probably by rough copying followed by
local modifications.  I intended to fragment most common clusters and
segregate the parts into virtual methods in outer classes, and override
these methods, as appropriate, with less common variants within inner
classes.  `mdiff' was good at pointing me to exactly where I should
look at.  Of course, it never did the cleanup for me, but it helped
doing the research about what should be done.  Reusing `mdiff' over the
half-cleaned project gave me more fine grained analysis of what was left
to consider.

2.1 Invoking `mdiff'
====================

The format for running the `mdiff' program is:

     mdiff OPTION ... FILE ...

   `mdiff' read all input FILEs and produces its results on standard
output.  Optionally, standard error might receive a progress report or
a few statistics.

   `wdiff' compares files OLD_FILE and NEW_FILE and produces an
annotated copy of NEW_FILE on standard output.  The empty string or the
string `-' denotes standard input, but standard input cannot be used
twice in the same invocation.  The complete path of a file should be
given, a directory name is not accepted.  `wdiff' will exit with a
status of 0 if no differences were found, a status of 1 if any
differences were found, or a status of 2 for any error.

   In this documentation, "deleted text" refers to text in OLD_FILE
which is not in NEW_FILE, while "inserted text" refers to text on
NEW_FILE which is not in OLD_FILE.

   `mdiff' supports the following command line options:

`--version'
     Merely prints the version numbers on standard output, and exits
     without doing anything else.

`--help'
     Merely prints a page of help on standard output, and exits without
     doing anything else.

`--statistics'
`-s'
     First tells the number of files read, and the number of lines found
     in this file.  Then says how many clusters have been found, how
     many members are covered by all clusters.  It also gives a number
     of lines which could have been spared if all reported repetitions
     were avoided, and this count excludes lines which are ignorable.
     All this output is directed to standard error.

`--threshold=NUMBER'
`-t NUMBER'
     Specifies the minimum number of non-ignorable lines which are
     required for two runs of lines to compare as equal.  No cluster
     member may ever have less than NUMBER lines.  By default, clusters
     have 4 lines or more.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print an informative help message describing the options.

`--version'
`-v'
     Print the version number of `wdiff' on the standard error output.

`--no-deleted'
`-1'
     Avoid producing deleted words on the output.  If neither `-1' or
     `-2' is selected, the original right margin may be exceeded for
     some lines.

`--no-inserted'
`-2'
     Avoid producing inserted words on the output.  When this flag is
     given, the whitespace in the output is taken from OLD_FILE instead
     of NEW_FILE.  If neither `-1' or `-2' is selected, the original
     right margin may be exceeded for some lines.

`--no-common'
`-3'
     Avoid producing common words on the output.  When this option is
     not selected, common words and whitespace are taken from NEW_FILE,
     unless option `-2' is given, in which case common words and
     whitespace are rather taken from OLD_FILE.  When selected,
     differences are separated from one another by lines of dashes.
     Moreover, if this option is selected at the same time as `-1' or
     `-2', then none of the output will have any emphasis, i.e. no bold
     or underlining.  Finally, if this option is not selected, but both
     `-1' and `-2' are, then sections of common words between
     differences are segregated by lines of dashes.

`--ignore-case'
`-c'
     Do not consider case difference while comparing words.  Each lower
     case letter is seen as identical to its upper case equivalent for
     the purpose of deciding if two words are the same.

`--statistics'
`-s'
     On completion, for each file, the total number of words, the
     number of common words between the files, the number of words
     deleted or inserted and the number of words that have changed is
     output.  (A changed word is one that has been replaced or is part
     of a replacement.)  Except for the total number of words, all of
     the numbers are followed by a percentage relative to the total
     number of words in the file.

`--auto-pager'
`-a'
     Some initiatives which were previously automatically taken in
     previous versions of `wdiff' are now put under the control of this
     option.  By using it, a pager is interposed whenever the `wdiff'
     output is directed to the user's terminal.  Without this option,
     no pager will be called, the user is then responsible for
     explicitly piping `wdiff' output into a pager, if required.

     The pager is selected by the value of the `PAGER' environment
     variable when `wdiff' is run.  If `PAGER' is not defined at run
     time, then a default pager, selected at installation time, will be
     used instead.  A defined but empty value of `PAGER' means no pager
     at all.

     When a pager is interposed through the use of this option, one of
     the options `-l' or `-t' is also selected, depending on whether
     the string `less' appears in the pager's name or not.

     It is often useful to define `wdiff' as an alias for `wdiff -a'.
     However, this _hides_ the normal `wdiff' behaviour.  The default
     behaviour may be restored simply by piping the output from `wdiff'
     through `cat'.  This dissociates the output from the user's
     terminal.

`--printer'
`-p'
     Use over-striking to emphasize parts of the output.  Each
     character of the deleted text is underlined by writing an
     underscore `_' first, then a backspace and then the letter to be
     underlined.  Each character of the inserted text is emboldened by
     writing it twice, with a backspace in between.  This option is not
     selected by default.

`--less-mode'
`-l'
     Use over-striking to emphasize parts of output.  This option works
     as option `-p', but also over-strikes whitespace associated with
     inserted text.  `less' shows such whitespace using reverse video.
     This option is not selected by default.  However, it is
     automatically turned on whenever `wdiff' launches the pager
     `less'.  See option `-a'.

     This option is commonly used in conjunction with `less':

          wdiff -l OLD_FILE NEW_FILE | less

`--terminal'
`-t'
     Force the production of `termcap' strings for emphasising parts of
     output, even if the standard output is not associated with a
     terminal.  The `TERM' environment variable must contain the name
     of a valid `termcap' entry.  If the terminal description permits,
     underlining is used for marking deleted text, while bold or
     reverse video is used for marking inserted text.  This option is
     not selected by default.  However, it is automatically turned on
     whenever `wdiff' launches a pager, and it is known that the pager
     is _not_ `less'.  See option `-a'.

     This option is commonly used when `wdiff' output is not redirected,
     but sent directly to the user terminal, as in:

          wdiff -t OLD_FILE NEW_FILE

     A common kludge uses `wdiff' together with the pager `more', as in:

          wdiff -t OLD_FILE NEW_FILE | more

     However, some versions of `more' use `termcap' emphasis for their
     own purposes, so strange interactions are possible.

`--start-delete ARGUMENT'
`-w ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "start delete" string.  This string will be
     output prior to any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it
     starts.  By default, no start delete string is used unless there
     is no other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in
     this case the default start delete string is `[-'.

`--end-delete ARGUMENT'
`-x ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "end delete" string.  This string will be
     output after any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it ends.
     By default, no end delete string is used unless there is no other
     means of distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the
     default end delete string is `-]'.

`--start-insert ARGUMENT'
`-y ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "start insert" string.  This string will be
     output prior to any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it
     starts.  By default, no start insert string is used unless there
     is no other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in
     this case the default start insert string is `{+'.

`--end-insert ARGUMENT'
`-z ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "end insert" string.  This string will be
     output after any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it ends.
     By default, no end insert string is used unless there is no other
     means of distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the
     default end insert string is `+}'.

`--avoid-wraps'
`-n'
     Avoid spanning the end of line while showing deleted or inserted
     text.  Any single fragment of deleted or inserted text spanning
     many lines will be considered as being made up of many smaller
     fragments not containing a newline.  So deleted text, for example,
     will have an end delete string at the end of each line, just
     before the new line, and a start delete string at the beginning of
     the next line.  A long paragraph of inserted text will have each
     line bracketed between start insert and end insert strings.  This
     behaviour is not selected by default.


   Some choices are hard-wired into the program, but might well become
options in later releases.  For example:

   * No cluster may span a file boundary, that is, start near the end
     of one input file and continue at the beginning of the next file.

   * A cluster may have many members from the same file.

   * White space is ignored between the beginning of a line and the
     first non-white character.

   * White space is significant when embedded in a line, or when ending
     a line.

   * Lines having no significant part (only white lines for now) are
     "ignorable".  Such ignorable lines are logically considered as not
     being part of the input files for the sake of comparisons.

   * Comments from the C language are not especially ignored.  Unless
     ignored for other reasons (being white lines), they are indeed
     significant lines.

   * No cluster member may ever directly start nor end with ignorable
     lines.  However, ignorable lines may still be embedded within a
     cluster member.

   * In the generated output, clusters containing the biggest number of
     ignorable lines are output first, while smaller clusters appear
     last.  All lines pertaining to a single cluster are output
     together.  Within a cluster, members are listed in the order of
     the initial reading of input files.


   Note that options `-p', `-t', and `-[wxyz]' are not mutually
exclusive.  If you use a combination of them, you will merely
accumulate the effect of each.  Option `-l' is a variant of option `-p'.

2.2 Actual examples of `mdiff' usage
====================================

This section presents a few examples of usage, most of them have been
contributed by `wdiff' users.

   * Change bars example.

        * This example comes from a discussion with Joe Wells,
          `jbw@cs.bu.edu'.

          The following command produces a copy of NEW_FILE, shifted
          right one space to accommodate change bars since the last
          revision, ignoring those changes coming only from paragraph
          refilling.  Any line with new or changed text will get a `|'
          in column 1.  However, deleted text is not shown nor marked.

               wdiff -1n OLD_FILE NEW_FILE |
                 sed -e 's/^/  /;/{+/s/^ /|/;s/{+//g;s/+}//g'

          Here is how it works.  Word differences are found, paying
          attention only to additions, as requested by option `-1'.
          For bigger changes which span line boundaries, the insert
          bracket strings are repeated on each output line, as
          requested by option `-n'.  This output is then reformatted
          with a `sed' script which shifts the text right two columns,
          turns the initial space into a bar only if there is some new
          text on that line, then removes all insert bracket strings.


   * `LaTeX' example.

        *  This example has been provided by Steve Fisk,
          `fisk@polar.bowdoin.edu'.

          The following uses LaTeX to put deleted text in boxes, and
          new text in double boxes:

               wdiff -w "\fbox{" -x "}" -y "\fbox{\fbox{" -z "}}" ...

          works nicely.


   * `troff' example.

        * This example comes from Paul Fox, `pgf@cayman.com'.

          Using `wdiff', with some `troff'-specific delimiters gives
          _much_ better output.  The delimiters I used:

               wdiff -w'\s-5' -x'\s0' -y'\fB' -z'\fP' ...

          This makes the pointsize of deletions 5 points smaller than
          normal, and emboldens insertions.  Fantastic!

          I experimented with:

               wdiff -w'\fI' -x'\fP' -y'\fB' -z'\fP'

          since that's more like the defaults you use for terminals or
          printers, but since I actually use italics for emphasis in my
          documents, I thought the point size thing was clearer.

          I tried it on code, and it works surprisingly well there,
          too...

        * Marty Leisner `leisner@eso.mc.xerox.com' says:

          In the previous example, you had smaller text being taken out
          and bold face inserted.  I had smaller text being taken out
          and larger text being inserted, I'm using bold face for other
          things, so this is more clear.

               wdiff -w '\s-3' -x'\s0' -y'\s+3' -z'\s0'



   On a related note, GNU Emacs users might notice that the interactive
function `compare-windows' ignores changes in whitespace, if it is
given a numeric argument.  If the variable `compare-ignore-case' is
non-`nil', it ignores differences in case as well.  So, in a way, this
offers a kind of incremental version of `wdiff'.

2.3 Resource considerations and efficiency
==========================================

Memory consumption
     `mdiff' can easily handle medium-sized project.  For a 32 bits
     architecture, the memory requirements may computed like this:

        * 8 bytes per file

        * 8 bytes per line

        * 4 bytes per cluster

        * 8 bytes per cluster member

Time consumption
     To evaluate the speed, consider the example shown above (*note
     mdiff::), and yielding these statistics:

          Read summary: 137 files, 41975 lines
          Work summary: 439 clusters, 1608 members ...

     Once many files in the memory cache, and redirecting the output to
     `/dev/null', the processing takes 3 seconds of real time on an
     Intel 486/100, which looks good.  I was indeed afraid of some
     hidden O(N^2) behaviour(1), even if the program is mostly
     O(N*log(N)).  Maybe one will discover or construct cases putting
     `mdiff' on its knees.  So far, `mdiff' seemingly behaves well for
     the little problems given to it.  If we devise and generate a more
     traditional `diff'-like output, in which all input files are
     relisted, this will add some time to the processing, but it will
     be only linear with regard with the total length of input files.

     There is a clever optimized sorting algorithm for _all_ substrings
     of a file, which might be generalised to handle words or lines for
     `mdiff'.  But since the program is already faster than we initially
     expected, there is no emergency to resort to using such an
     algorithm.

Trading complexity for clarity
     When lines repeat a lot, there are surprisingly many ways to
     relate blocks of lines, and reporting them _all_ can make very
     hairy listings.  Any choice about reporting similarities, or not,
     is somewhat arbitrary, but we ought to make some of such choices
     for the program to be practical.  Some of these choices are
     detailed here.

     If all members of a given cluster A are proper subsets of all
     members of another given cluster B, then cluster A is wholly
     forgotten.  However, let's presume for example that there are more
     members in A than in B.  Then, some members of A necessarily
     appear unrelated to any member of B.  In such case, it has been
     decided more useful to report _all_ occurrences of A members, even
     those embedded within occurrences of B members.  When only
     interested in members B, annotations pertaining to A may be
     perceived as clutter.  However, when interested in members of A,
     getting all of them is probably the most useful choice.

     It sometimes happen that members of a very same cluster overlap.
     In the string `a a a', there are two overlapping members for the
     cluster represented by the string `a a', one from the first two
     `a', another from the last two `a'.  In such cases, one member of
     such an overlap is automatically chopped so the overlap does not
     occur.

     White lines and items containing only delimiters are the possible
     source of a lot of complexity, if these are fully taken as
     significant.  Since this does not add much to clarity, they are
     better ignored, usually, through using `--ignore-blank-lines'
     (`-B') or `--ignore-delimiters' (`-j').  Increasing the value of
     `--minimum-size=ITEMS' (`-J ITEMS') option also cut off complexity
     in favor of clarity, yet some small matches may then go unnoticed.
     Exactly how to best adjust the ITEMS value is left for the user
     to decide.

3 The word difference finder
****************************

The program `wdiff' is a front end to `mdiff' for comparing files on a
word per word basis.

   In the first releases of the package, `wdiff' was a front-end to
`diff' as found in the GNU `diffutils' package.  Many users suggested
features, which were in turn inviting for the integration of `wdiff'
into `diffutils'.  Collaboration proved to be rather difficult.  After
a few years, the `wdiff' author finally gave in and created `mdiff' as
a way to break out of the situation and for becoming able to proceed
with users' suggestions.

   A word is anything between whitespace.  This is useful for comparing
two texts in which a few words have been changed and for which
paragraphs have been refilled.

3.1 Invoking `wdiff'
====================

The format for running the `wdiff' program is:

     wdiff OPTION ... OLD_FILE NEW_FILE

   `wdiff' compares files OLD_FILE and NEW_FILE and produces an
annotated copy of NEW_FILE on standard output.  The empty string or the
string `-' denotes standard input, but standard input cannot be used
twice in the same invocation.  The complete path of a file should be
given, a directory name is not accepted.  `wdiff' will exit with a
status of 0 if no differences were found, a status of 1 if any
differences were found, or a status of 2 for any error.

   In this documentation, "deleted text" refers to text in OLD_FILE
which is not in NEW_FILE, while "inserted text" refers to text on
NEW_FILE which is not in OLD_FILE.

   `wdiff' supports the following command line options:

`--help'
`-h'
     Print an informative help message describing the options.

`--version'
`-v'
     Print the version number of `wdiff' on the standard error output.

`--no-deleted'
`-1'
     Avoid producing deleted words on the output.  If neither `-1' or
     `-2' is selected, the original right margin may be exceeded for
     some lines.

`--no-inserted'
`-2'
     Avoid producing inserted words on the output.  When this flag is
     given, the whitespace in the output is taken from OLD_FILE instead
     of NEW_FILE.  If neither `-1' or `-2' is selected, the original
     right margin may be exceeded for some lines.

`--no-common'
`-3'
     Avoid producing common words on the output.  When this option is
     not selected, common words and whitespace are taken from NEW_FILE,
     unless option `-2' is given, in which case common words and
     whitespace are rather taken from OLD_FILE.  When selected,
     differences are separated from one another by lines of dashes.
     Moreover, if this option is selected at the same time as `-1' or
     `-2', then none of the output will have any emphasis, i.e. no bold
     or underlining.  Finally, if this option is not selected, but both
     `-1' and `-2' are, then sections of common words between
     differences are segregated by lines of dashes.

`--ignore-case'
`-c'
     Do not consider case difference while comparing words.  Each lower
     case letter is seen as identical to its upper case equivalent for
     the purpose of deciding if two words are the same.

`--statistics'
`-s'
     On completion, for each file, the total number of words, the
     number of common words between the files, the number of words
     deleted or inserted and the number of words that have changed is
     output.  (A changed word is one that has been replaced or is part
     of a replacement.)  Except for the total number of words, all of
     the numbers are followed by a percentage relative to the total
     number of words in the file.

`--auto-pager'
`-a'
     Some initiatives which were previously automatically taken in
     previous versions of `wdiff' are now put under the control of this
     option.  By using it, a pager is interposed whenever the `wdiff'
     output is directed to the user's terminal.  Without this option,
     no pager will be called, the user is then responsible for
     explicitly piping `wdiff' output into a pager, if required.

     The pager is selected by the value of the `PAGER' environment
     variable when `wdiff' is run.  If `PAGER' is not defined at run
     time, then a default pager, selected at installation time, will be
     used instead.  A defined but empty value of `PAGER' means no pager
     at all.

     When a pager is interposed through the use of this option, one of
     the options `-l' or `-t' is also selected, depending on whether
     the string `less' appears in the pager's name or not.

     It is often useful to define `wdiff' as an alias for `wdiff -a'.
     However, this _hides_ the normal `wdiff' behaviour.  The default
     behaviour may be restored simply by piping the output from `wdiff'
     through `cat'.  This dissociates the output from the user's
     terminal.

`--printer'
`-p'
     Use over-striking to emphasize parts of the output.  Each
     character of the deleted text is underlined by writing an
     underscore `_' first, then a backspace and then the letter to be
     underlined.  Each character of the inserted text is emboldened by
     writing it twice, with a backspace in between.  This option is not
     selected by default.

`--less-mode'
`-l'
     Use over-striking to emphasize parts of output.  This option works
     as option `-p', but also over-strikes whitespace associated with
     inserted text.  `less' shows such whitespace using reverse video.
     This option is not selected by default.  However, it is
     automatically turned on whenever `wdiff' launches the pager
     `less'.  See option `-a'.

     This option is commonly used in conjunction with `less':

          wdiff -l OLD_FILE NEW_FILE | less

`--terminal'
`-t'
     Force the production of `termcap' strings for emphasising parts of
     output, even if the standard output is not associated with a
     terminal.  The `TERM' environment variable must contain the name
     of a valid `termcap' entry.  If the terminal description permits,
     underlining is used for marking deleted text, while bold or
     reverse video is used for marking inserted text.  This option is
     not selected by default.  However, it is automatically turned on
     whenever `wdiff' launches a pager, and it is known that the pager
     is _not_ `less'.  See option `-a'.

     This option is commonly used when `wdiff' output is not redirected,
     but sent directly to the user terminal, as in:

          wdiff -t OLD_FILE NEW_FILE

     A common kludge uses `wdiff' together with the pager `more', as in:

          wdiff -t OLD_FILE NEW_FILE | more

     However, some versions of `more' use `termcap' emphasis for their
     own purposes, so strange interactions are possible.

`--start-delete ARGUMENT'
`-w ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "start delete" string.  This string will be
     output prior to any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it
     starts.  By default, no start delete string is used unless there
     is no other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in
     this case the default start delete string is `[-'.

`--end-delete ARGUMENT'
`-x ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "end delete" string.  This string will be
     output after any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it ends.
     By default, no end delete string is used unless there is no other
     means of distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the
     default end delete string is `-]'.

`--start-insert ARGUMENT'
`-y ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "start insert" string.  This string will be
     output prior to any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it
     starts.  By default, no start insert string is used unless there
     is no other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in
     this case the default start insert string is `{+'.

`--end-insert ARGUMENT'
`-z ARGUMENT'
     Use ARGUMENT as the "end insert" string.  This string will be
     output after any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it ends.
     By default, no end insert string is used unless there is no other
     means of distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the
     default end insert string is `+}'.

`--avoid-wraps'
`-n'
     Avoid spanning the end of line while showing deleted or inserted
     text.  Any single fragment of deleted or inserted text spanning
     many lines will be considered as being made up of many smaller
     fragments not containing a newline.  So deleted text, for example,
     will have an end delete string at the end of each line, just
     before the new line, and a start delete string at the beginning of
     the next line.  A long paragraph of inserted text will have each
     line bracketed between start insert and end insert strings.  This
     behaviour is not selected by default.

   Note that options `-p', `-t', and `-[wxyz]' are not mutually
exclusive.  If you use a combination of them, you will merely
accumulate the effect of each.  Option `-l' is a variant of option `-p'.

4 The diff format converter
***************************

The program `unify' has the purpose of manipulating context diffs and
unified context diffs.  `unify' will accept either a regular context
diff (old- or new-style) or a unified context diff as input, and
generate either a unified diff or a new-style context diff as output.

   Various other options allow you to echo the non-diff (comment) lines
to stderr, modify the diff by removing the comment lines, and/or tweak
the diff into a format that is good for releasing patches.

   I think most people prefer unified context diffs in general.  But
some of us just have trouble reading unidiffs, unless they get very
simple.  Usual context diffs show how the code was _before_, and then,
how the code is _after_.  Some people just prefer understanding twice
thoroughly, than once fuzzily.  The tool is useful for those who handle
a lot of diffs from various sources, and want them in a uniform format.

4.1 Invoking `unify'
====================

The format for running the `unify' program is:

     unify OPTION ... [FILE]

   The program reads the diff to convert from FILE, or if the source
file is not mentioned, it will be read from the standard input.  The
default is to output the diff in the opposite style of whatever was
input, that is, regular context diffs will become unified context diffs,
and unified context diffs will become unified context diffs, but this
can be overridden by options.

   `unify' supports the following command line options:

`--version'
     Merely prints the version numbers on standard output, and exits
     without doing anything else.

`--help'
     Merely prints a page of help on standard output, and exits without
     doing anything else.

`--context-diffs'
`-c'
     Forces context diff output.

`--echo-comments'
`-e'
     Echoes non-diff (comment) lines to stderr.  If a comment line is
     being stripped via the `-p' option, it is echoed with a preceding
     `!!! '.  If all comments are being stripped (via the `-s' option),
     no special designation is given.

`--old-diffs'
`-o'
     Is used to force a context diff to be interpreted as being of the
     old-style even if it has the extra trailing asterisks that
     normally mark the new-style.  This is only needed if `unify' fails
     to work with your version of `diff'.

`--patch-format'
`-p'
     Turns on patch-output mode.  This will do two things:

       1. Transform a header like:

               *** orig/file	Sat May  5 02:59:37 1990
               --- ./file	Sat May  5 03:00:08 1990

          into a line of `Index: file' -- we choose the shorter name
          and strip a leading `./' sequence if present.

       2. Strip lines that begin with `Only in ', `Common subdir',
          `Binary files' or `diff -'.


`-P'
     Is the same as `-p'.

`--strip-comments'
`-s'
     Strips non-diff lines (comments).

`--unidiffs'
`-u'
     Forces unified diff output.

`-U'
     Is the same as `-up'.

`--use-equals'
`-='
     Will use a `=' prefix in a unified diff for lines that are common
     to both files instead of using a leading space.  Though this is
     harder to read, it is less likely to be mangled by
     trailing-space-stripping sites when posted to Usenet.

5 How `mdiff' differs
*********************

The GNU project already has a `diff' program which is part of the
`diffutils' package.  There also are various non-GNU `diff' programs
provided by various constructors.  There was a previous version of
`wdiff' which was using GNU `diff' under the scene.  The following
sections compare `mdiff' specifications with both GNU `diff' and with
`wdiff'.

* wdiff Compatibility::         Differences with `wdiff'

5.1 Differences with `diff'
===========================

GNU `diff' is a program which matured for a long while, and for which
algorithms are based on computer science literature.  It is a fast
program.  By comparison, `mdiff' is not more than a program kludged up
rapidly to satisfy a few precise needs.  It only tries not being
inordinately slow.

   Most `diff' options are accepted by `mdiff' under the same short and
long option names, and is able to produce resembling output, for making
`mdiff' easier to learn and less surprising to users.  Yet, some
differences exist in option decoding and output format.  Since `diff'
and `wdiff' use different matching algorithms, it is very likely that
the differences will not be exactly analyzed identically.

   * A few `diff' options, which either accept no argument or require a
     mandatory one, are implemented in `mdiff' as options accepting an
     optional argument.  This may yield some surprises, for example,
     `-c4bir' would be accepted by `diff' and rejected by `mdiff', yet
     it may rewritten `-birc4' for both.  See below.

   * Options `-c' and `-u' in `diff' ask for regular context and
     unified context output, respectively, without specifying the number
     of lines in the context.  `diff' has `-C NUMBER' and `-U NUMBER'
     options for asking for regular or unified context diffs with
     NUMBER context lines.  If `-c4' asks for four lines of context,
     the `4' is not really an argument of `-c', and this is really
     interpreted as `-c -4', where `-NUMBER' is meant to be a
     deprecated option for choosing the number of context lines, option
     which `mdiff' does not implement.  In `mdiff', `-c' and `-u' are
     really two options which are allowed to receive an optional
     argument, so the number of lines may, or may not be given, at the
     choice of the user.  In `mdiff', options `-C' and `-U' are
     completely equivalent to `-c' and `-u', and are provided only for
     the sake of compatibility.

   * Option `-v' in `diff' means `--version', while it means
     `--verbose' in `mdiff'.  There is no short form for `--version' in
     `mdiff'.



File: wdiff.info,  Node: wdiff Compatibility,  Prev: diff Compatibility,  Up: Compatibility

5.2 Differences with `wdiff'
============================

Even if `mdiff' is meant to fully support `wdiff', options have been
shuffled around so `mdiff' could better merge both `diff' and `wdiff'
options in a common scheme.  `diff' habits were almost always favored
in this option reorganisation.

   In fact, `wdiff' is now a mere front-end to `mdiff' that only
rewrites the options.  The following notes apply.

   * Some options are just transmitted unchanged, these are `-1', `-2',
     `-3' and `-i'.

   * Option `-c' also gets turned into `-i', to be compatible with
     `wdiff' versions up to `0.4'.

   * Simple option `-a' in `wdiff' becomes `-A' in `mdiff', `-l'
     becomes `-k', `-n' becomes `-m', `-p' becomes `-o', `-s' becomes
     `-v' and `-t' becomes `-z'.

   * Options introducing strings, which are `-w', `-x', `-y' and `-z'
     in `wdiff', respectively become `-Y', `-Z', `-Q' and `-R' in
     `mdiff'.

   * Options `-C', `-h' and `-v' are processed directly by `wdiff' and
     are not transmitted to `mdiff'.

   * Further, the `-C' option of `wdiff' has no equivalent in `mdiff'.

   * A new option `-q' inhibits the message which explains how `mdiff'
     might have been directly called.
